* Abstract
** 'Factories' for transcription and Replication
** Developed a method to capture Intra- and inter-chromosomal
** Generated a 1Kb resolution map of the haploid genome
*** Validates old features/ identifies new ones
*** Extensive Regional and Higher order folding observed
*** TODO Implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end
*** Inter-chromosomal interations anchored by centromeres
** Constructed a 3D model of the yeast genome
* Introduction
** 3C has been used to detect long-range interactions between chromosomes
** Created a NEW method using 4C and massively parallel sequencing
*** Established Reliability by assessing
1. Random intermolecular ligations from each of five control libraries
2. Restriction site-based biases
3. Reproducibility between independent sets of experimental libraries
that differed in DNA concentration at the 3C step, which critically
influences signal-to-noise ratios
4. Consistency between the HindIII and EcoRI libraries
5. A set of 24 chromosomal interactions using conventional 3C
